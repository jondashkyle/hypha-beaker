<h1 align="center">Hypha Beaker Example</h1>

A little single-page-app style site generator for Beaker using [Hypha](https://github.com/jondashkyle/hypha).

## Usage

- Format a directory of content as described in the [Hypha documentation](https://github.com/jondashkyle/hypha).
- Build a choo app to render your content `/site`

## Customization

- Run `npm install` inside `/site` to install the dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to watch for changes to your siteâ€™s source during dev.
- Run `npm run build` to build your site!

## Notes

- If cloning into a Dat archive within Beaker, ensure you edit your `dat.json` file to include `{ "fallback_page": "index.html" }`. This will be fixed in an upcoming version of Beaker.

## Todo

- Use the Enoki Panel in /panel
